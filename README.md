# Http server in rust from scratch

This repo contains attempts to write basic http server in Rust from scratch.
The main purpouse is to better understand how http works.
Currently there are few implementations in branches:

- http1 = Base http1 implementation with std
- async-http1 = Async version with Tokio

This is in no means complete implementation of HTTP, since it's being developed only as rust exercise.
